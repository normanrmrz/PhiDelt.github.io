        <h1>About Texas Beta</h1>
        <div class="container">
        <p>The Texas Beta chapter of Phi Delta Theta was chartered on October 15, 1883, as the 67th chapter of Phi Delta Theta and the second chapter in Texas. The Tennessee Alpha chapter (Vanderbilt) was instrumental in the establishment of Texas Beta. In 1883, Sterling P. Gilbert and Walter B. Palmer of Tennessee Alpha solicited two of their alumni, Drew Pruit of Fort Worth and Isaac Hill Bryant of Austin, to establish a chapter of Phi Delta Theta at the new University of Texas at Austin. Seven men were initiated by Pruit and Bryant on October 8, 1883: Owens Pickett Hale, Constance Pessels, Quitman Finlay, Dewitt Habsein Hotchkiss, Franklin Huff Raymond, Robert Waverly Smith, and Hugh N. Swain. These men, in addition to John Isaac Hedrick, were granted a charter for the Texas Beta chapter of Phi Delta Theta on October 15, 1883, making Phi Delta Theta the first fraternity organized on campus at Texas. By the end of 1883, 15 men had been initiated into the Texas Beta chapter. Quitman Finlay was the first man to sign the Bond and received bond number 1.

In 1885, 6 former members of the W.W.W. (Rainbow Fraternity) were initiated into Texas Beta. These men had refused to join Delta Tau Delta as the remainder of their chapters nationally did. Texas Beta was also involved in the initiation of the former members of the Southwestern chapter of the W.W.W. into Phi Delta Theta, as the Texas Gamma chapter, in 1886.

In 1900, the chapter rented its first chapter house at 2006 University Avenue (now the location of the University Catholic Center) and was the second fraternity on campus to have a chapter house. In September, 1902, the fraternity completed a frame house at West 23rd and San Antonio Streets, the first purpose-built fraternity house on campus, and was the first fraternity at Texas to own its own chapter house. The lot is now home to University Co-Op parking garage. In 1953, the chapter moved to a brand new house at 2300 Nueces, which is now home to The Quarters apartments. The chapter has more recently resided at 2614 Rio Grande (now the Acacia house) and 2806 Nueces (now the Zeta Psi house). In 2012, the chapter completed renovation of its current home at 1904 Nueces.

In 1997, General Headquarters pulled the charter of Texas Beta after 114 years of continuous presence on the UT campus. However, the fraternity would not be gone for long. Recolonization soon began with Texas Beta Kappa, a local business fraternity, forming the base of the new colony. On April 28, 2000, a charter was granted to 38 re-founding fathers of the Texas Beta chapter, beginning a new era in the chapter’s history. The chapter celebrated its 130th anniversary on October 15, 2013, and has initiated a total of 2,009 men since its foundation in 1883.
